# Airport Reservation System SQL Project

This project was completed during the Spring 2025 semester at Miami Dade College for the course **CGS 1540**. The professor for this course was **Professor Massad**. This work supports my pursuit of an Associate of Science degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Overview

This is an **Airport Reservation System** project implemented entirely in SQL. The system simulates a database environment that manages flights, passengers, tickets, and reservations for an airport.

## Tools and Resources

- SQL queries were developed and tested on [OneCompiler.com](https://onecompiler.com).
